# mime

Mime is a text processing tool inspired by Emacs,  written in C++.

Mime provides an editor-like abstraction for manipulating text files,
but in a scripting environment,  without an editor.  This enables very
sophisticated transformations that are easy to do through tools
like Emacs Keyboard Macros,  but hard to do in code.

You will find a sample mime script [here](example.md).
